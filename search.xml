      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Years ago, I started to climb over GFW and embrace a brand new Internet world. It’s fantac. Even though there are many unreal rumors about China, I still find large amounts of useful information and Google definitely improved my efficiency. There are various of ways to fuck GFW. I used to use shadowsocks but now I turn to hosts and IPV6. So I’d like to make a summary of these methods and I would continally add more methods if I find them really useful. Github Education PackageGithub education package contains dozens of software to help students work and study. Most of all, it supplies a $50 credits for digital ocean, which can be used to set up your vps. According to my test, the Sanfrancisco hosts and Singapore hosts are faster than others in China. VPNThis is a classic way to go over GFW. You can set up PPTP, L2TP or IPSec VPN servers on your own vps. Or you can buy one account. Here are some famous websites for this: 云梯 Recommendations from other website. LanternSome people recommend this months ago. I didn’t try it but they said it’s fascinating. You can explore it at its official website. And this is a blog for reference. ShadowsocksShadowsocks is now very popular in China because of its security and all-platform support. I used it for nearly two years on my Android phone and some of my servers. It’s easy for a programmer or handyman to set up a shadowsocks server on his own vps. You can follow the steps from this blog. It’s a complete tutorial. HostsThese days I found this approach quite fascinating in its speed and fast configuration. Here I recommend two well-maintained repositories for use: IPV4 hosts IPV6 hosts For education net user, I greatly recommend you to use the IPV6 version or combine them together. For ordinary users, the first one also works well. DNS serverThis is a alternative method to Hosts. But I should emphasize here it’s not stable. Since some dns requests will be detected by GFW and GFW will return you with a dummy ip address. Also, sometimes the dns servers may get polluted. However, despite its unstability, this method works in my iPhone/iPad device, since you cannot change the hosts file without rooting the device. Good dns servers are listed here: Google IPV4 DNS: 8.8.8.8 nad 8.8.4.4 Google IPV6 DNS: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and 2001:4860:4860::8844 OpenDNS IPV4 and IPV6 mixed DNS (IPV6 first): 2620:0:ccc::2 and 2620:0:ccd::2 To summarize, if you are in education net, like myself, I greatly suggest the Hosts method, because you can take advantage of IPV6 and the access is much faster. And for Iphone/Ipad device with out root, you can use the IPV6 dns server. Even though it’s not very stable, I find most of useful websites are always available.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Our lab is equiped with a new workstation recently. I spent some time studying how to assembly such a computer for deep learning and configure the deep learning environment. Finally I made it and here is a picture of the inner architecure. Quite cool, aha? We have one Intel 6850K CPU and two GTX 1080 gpu cards in it, which I think is enough for our small lab to do some deep learning experiments in NLP. Of course, we don’t want to compete with other big group in the Neural Machine Learning field. And now my work space is like this: I have to say it’s quite comfortable and I even want to sleep here when the cold winter comes!]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[After the first two headache months of my graduate study, I’m ready to re-launch this blog today. I’m going to write some of my technical practices, research strucggles and interesting daily stories here. Hopefully I can continue this good habit to write blogs sometimes. And thanks for your visiting and hope you can enjoy something here. Now let’s start!]]></content>
